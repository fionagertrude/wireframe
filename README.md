# wireframing
Wireframing is the display of the basic layout, structure and functionality of a proposed app or website.

The importance of wireframing is:
• Visual plan: Shows the basic structure and layout before design or coding.
• Improves communication: Helps teams and stakeholders align on ideas.
• Saves time and cost: Easier to make changes early in the process.
• Enhances user experience: Ensures navigation and flow make sense for users.
• Guides development: Serves as a roadmap for designers and developers.

Key Elements of Wireframes
• Layout: Defines the overall structure and arrangement of elements on a page, helping users easily navigate and understand the interface.
• Navigation: Shows how users move between pages or sections through menus, buttons, and links, ensuring smooth interaction.
• Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will appear, emphasizing information hierarchy and readability.
• Functionality: Represents interactive features like forms, search bars, or buttons, showing how users will engage with the system.

Types of Wireframes
• Low-Fidelity Wireframes:
Simple sketches or basic digital outlines that focus on layout, structure, and content placement. They are quick to create and useful in early design stages for brainstorming and gathering feedback.
•High-Fidelity Wireframes:
More detailed and polished versions that include accurate spacing, typography, and sometimes interactive elements. They are used in later design phases to refine visuals and functionality before development.
In summary: Low-fidelity wireframes help explore ideas quickly, while high-fidelity wireframes validate detailed design and user interactions.

Figma is a powerful tool for wireframing because it combines easy design creation with real-time collaboration. It allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, making teamwork and feedback seamless. Figma’s intuitive interface, pre-built design components, and cloud-based access make it simple to create, share, and edit wireframes from anywhere. Its powerful vector editing tools and prototyping features also help designers move smoothly from basic wireframes to interactive, high-fidelity designs—all within one platform.
