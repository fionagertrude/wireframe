# wireframe
Wireframing is the display of the basic layout, structure and functionality of a proposed app or website.
The importance of wireframing is: 
• Visual plan: Shows the basic structure and layout before design or coding.
• Improves communication: Helps teams and stakeholders align on ideas.
• Saves time and cost: Easier to make changes early in the process.
• Enhances user experience: Ensures navigation and flow make sense for users.
• Guides development: Serves as a roadmap for designers and developers.
